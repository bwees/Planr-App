# Planr App

A React-Native homework planning app that I wrote for the 2021 PA Media and Design Competition, This was my first use of React-Native to build an app.
This app implemented a Google Classroom connection to handle importing of assignments into Planr.

The app is buggy (mainly lists do not update properly) and is no longer developed.
